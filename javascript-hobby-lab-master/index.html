                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>Mountain bikes are a fun way to exercise and connect with nature. Compared to road bikes, they
                        have the following characteristics:

                        fatter tires with rugged tread for stability and durability on off-road terrain
                        a more upright cycling position that lets you enjoy the view
                        suspension systems on some bikes absorb shock for a more comfortable ride
                        There are many ways to enjoy mountain biking, and you don’t even have to be in the mountains.
                        Trails vary from pleasant rides on wide, flowing logging roads to high-adrenaline challenges on
                        technical singletrack.

                        In this article, we'll tell you the basics of what to expect before your first ride, including
                        an overview of different types of mountain bike terrain,
                        styles of mountain biking and basics for getting geared up for a fun time on the trails.</p>
